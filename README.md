# HEY THERE!!!

This my portfolio code that uses sveltekit, skeletonUI, threlte(three.js) and Motion one to display what i have been doing.

for simplicity sake and too avoid to many questions, a lot of comments will be littered around for anyone who is unfamiliar with the technologies i've used or, would like to know my thought process behind a specific approach.  

It ain't much but right now but this is where ill be updating my project work too.

## Developing

Once you've cloned the project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server like so:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your edited version of the portfolio:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> NOTE: to deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment as this specific repos target will change as the years go on.
